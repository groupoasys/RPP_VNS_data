# RPP_VNS_data

## Goals ⚽

The aim of this repository is to provide some details of the data sets used in paper [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417425007444). This article has been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://groupoasys.github.io/). We suggest you visit the related links to know more our research 😉

## Summary 🧮📊📖

This repo contains the data for the four instances that are used in the paper to show the efficiency of our proposal.

For each dataset, you can find two files, called budgets.csv and satisfaction.csv. The budget file contains a column vector of size $K$, where $K$ denotes the number of customers. The file satisfaction.csv includes a $I\times K$, where $I$ denotes the number of products. The component $(i, k)$ of the matrix represents the preference value for product $i$ of customer $k$.
